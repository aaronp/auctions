# Contract Artifacts

This directory should contain the compiled contract artifacts for real blockchain deployment.

## Setup for Real Deployment

To enable real contract deployment instead of simulation:

### 1. Compile Contracts
```bash
# From the root directory (/Users/aaron/dev/sandbox/auctions/)
make test
```

### 2. Copy Artifacts
After compilation, copy the contract artifacts to this directory:

```bash
# Copy BondToken artifacts
cp artifacts/contracts/BondToken.sol/BondToken.json ui/issuer/public/contracts/

# Copy BondAuction artifacts  
cp artifacts/contracts/BondAuction.sol/BondAuction.json ui/issuer/public/contracts/
```

### 3. Required Files
The following files are needed for real deployment:
- `BondToken.json` - Contains ABI and bytecode for BondToken contract
- `BondAuction.json` - Contains ABI and bytecode for BondAuction contract

### 4. File Structure
Each JSON file should have this structure:
```json
{
  "abi": [...],
  "bytecode": "0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b50...",
  "contractName": "BondToken",
  "sourceName": "contracts/BondToken.sol"
}
```

## Development vs Production

### Without Artifacts (Development Mode)
- ‚úÖ App works with simulated deployment
- ‚úÖ All UI functionality available
- ‚úÖ Form state management works
- ‚ùå No real blockchain interaction
- ‚ùå Mock addresses and transaction hashes

### With Artifacts (Production Mode)  
- ‚úÖ Real contract deployment to blockchain
- ‚úÖ Actual transaction hashes
- ‚úÖ Real contract addresses
- ‚úÖ Full MetaMask integration
- ‚ùå Requires compiled contracts

## Error Messages

If you see these errors, it means artifacts are missing:

- `"Deployment failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'"` - 404 page received instead of JSON
- `"Contract artifacts not available"` - Files don't exist or are invalid
- `"Falling back to simulated deployment"` - Using mock deployment instead

## Networks Supported

The deployment system supports:
- **Base Sepolia** (chainId: 84532) - Testnet
- **Base Mainnet** (chainId: 8453) - Production  
- **Hardhat Local** (chainId: 31337) - Local development

## Gas Requirements

Make sure your wallet has sufficient ETH for gas fees:
- **BondToken deployment**: ~0.01-0.02 ETH
- **BondAuction deployment**: ~0.015-0.025 ETH

## Troubleshooting

1. **"Artifacts not found"**: Run `make test` and copy artifacts
2. **"Invalid JSON"**: Check file format and syntax
3. **"Bytecode empty"**: Recompile contracts with `make clean && make test`
4. **"Deployment failed"**: Check wallet connection and gas fees

## Quick Setup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run from project root
echo "Compiling contracts..."
make test

echo "Copying artifacts..."
mkdir -p ui/issuer/public/contracts
cp artifacts/contracts/BondToken.sol/BondToken.json ui/issuer/public/contracts/
cp artifacts/contracts/BondAuction.sol/BondAuction.json ui/issuer/public/contracts/

echo "‚úÖ Contract artifacts ready for deployment!"
echo "üí° Now you can use real blockchain deployment in the UI"
```
