# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment of the Bond Auction Platform.

## Workflows

### ðŸš€ deploy-all.yml (Main Workflow)
**Purpose**: Deploys both the UI application and documentation to GitHub Pages

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` or `master` branch
- Changes to `ui/issuer/**`, `docs/**`, or workflow file
- Manual trigger via workflow dispatch

**What it does**:
1. Builds the React UI application
2. Builds the Slidev documentation
3. Combines both into a single deployment:
   - UI app at root (`/`)
   - Documentation at `/docs/`
4. Creates a landing page with links to both
5. Deploys everything to GitHub Pages

**URLs after deployment**:
- Landing: `https://[username].github.io/[repo]/landing.html`
- UI App: `https://[username].github.io/[repo]/`
- Docs: `https://[username].github.io/[repo]/docs/`

### ðŸ“š deploy-slides.yml (Legacy - Disabled)
**Purpose**: Originally for deploying only documentation (now disabled)
- Kept for reference but superseded by `deploy-all.yml`
- Can still be triggered manually if needed

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
3. Save the settings

### 2. Verify Base Paths
The workflows automatically set the correct base paths for your repository.
If your repo is named differently, the paths will adjust accordingly.

### 3. First Deployment
1. Make any small change to trigger the workflow
2. Or go to Actions tab â†’ Select workflow â†’ Run workflow
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Check the Actions tab for the deployment URL

## Local Testing

To test the GitHub Pages build locally:

```bash
# Use the provided build script
./build-for-pages.sh

# Or manually:
cd deploy
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000/
```

## File Structure After Deployment

```
GitHub Pages Root
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # UI application
â”œâ”€â”€ landing.html        # Landing page with links
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/            # UI assets
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/         # Contract ABIs
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/              # Documentation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html     # Slidev presentation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/        # Slide assets
â””â”€â”€ [other UI files]
```

## Customization

### Changing Repository Name
If your repository name changes, update:
1. Nothing! The workflows use `${{ github.event.repository.name }}` automatically

### Adding More Build Steps
Edit `.github/workflows/deploy-all.yml` to add:
- Additional build steps
- Environment variables
- Different Node versions
- Other static assets

### Separate Deployments
If you need to deploy UI and docs separately:
1. Re-enable `deploy-slides.yml`
2. Create a separate `deploy-ui.yml`
3. Use different branches or deployment environments

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node version compatibility (using Node 20)
- Ensure `package-lock.json` files are committed
- Verify all dependencies are listed in `package.json`

### 404 Errors
- Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub Pages to propagate
- Check that base paths are correct in build output
- Verify the repository has GitHub Pages enabled

### Wrong Base Path
- The workflow automatically uses your repository name
- For custom domains, modify the base path in the workflow

## Environment Variables

The workflows set these automatically:
- Base path for UI: `/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/`
- Base path for docs: `/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/docs/`

## Security

- Workflows have minimal required permissions
- Uses `contents: read` for code access
- Uses `pages: write` and `id-token: write` for deployment
- No secrets or sensitive data in workflows
